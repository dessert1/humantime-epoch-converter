## `humantime-epoch-converter` is a Python library for converting the *human datetime specifications* into Epoch (seconds since 1st January, 1970).

Some examples of the supported input datetime specifications (**all specifications are case-insensitive**):

- `yesterday` (assumed `yesterday at 00:00:00`)

- `today at 7:30 PM`

- `now + 7 hours 30 minutes`

- `tomorrow 8`

- `today 14:45:04`

- `next sunday` (assumed `next sunday 00:00:00`)

- `next wed - 1 hr 30 mins 42 seconds'

- `today at 5:05 - 1 hour 40 seconds`


### I would suggest you to try and find out for any supported formats.
